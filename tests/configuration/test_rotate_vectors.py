"""
Unit tests for the rotate_vectors function.

Tests cover:
    - Rotation accuracy for standard angles (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
    - Non-integer and negative angle values
    - Empty dictionary handling
    - Multiple vector transformations in single operation
    - Input immutability verification
    - Error handling for invalid vector formats
