    - Streamlit's `st.markdown` is used to apply custom CSS styles.
    - The `option_menu` function creates the menu bar with specified tabs and icons.
    - The `unsafe_allow_html=True` parameter enables Streamlit to render raw HTML and CSS.
    - The `styles` dictionary customizes the appearance of the menu bar.
    - The icon can be changed using resources from https://icons.getbootstrap.com/.
