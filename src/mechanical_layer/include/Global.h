    This software is a computer program designed to generate a realistic crowd from anthropometric data and
    simulate the mechanical interactions that occur within it and with obstacles.

    of free software.  You can  use, modify and/ or redistribute the software under the terms of the CeCILL

    In this respect, the user's attention is drawn to the risks associated with loading,  using,  modifying
    and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user in light of its specific status of free software,
    that may mean  that it is complicated to manipulate,  and  that  also therefore means  that it is reserved
    for developers  and  experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore
    encouraged to load and test the software's suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling
    the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,  more generally, to use and operate it in the
    same conditions as regards security.
